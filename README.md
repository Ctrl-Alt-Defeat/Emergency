# we drew our frame work in a cloud whiteboard and we included a picture for the wire frame in the main directory of the demo 

# the user should sign up to the web app and then go to map page to search for other user on his demand, he can add questions and answer them.

# we used 2 APIs:
1. Mapbox : to get the exact location for the user while signup and on his demand to update his location
2. Exchangerate : to provide the ability for the user to git the value of his homeland currency if he got paid in other currencies 

# Our database has a lot of forks because we built a site with different needed information so we connected different tables together in order to keep following of the data for the same user. We provide a structure for the database in our main directory for the demo.
